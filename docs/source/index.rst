Welcome to the SuperLOTIS UV camera documentation!
===================================

**SuperLOTIS** (Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System) is an optical, robotic 60cm telescope located at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), in Tucson, Arizona. It is the first ground-based optical telescope adapted for NUV observations of transients. The telescope utilizes the SOPHIA 2048B UV instrument for exposures. 
SOPHIA is an ultra low-noise CCD camera with high sensitivity for UV/VIS observations. This camera and the associated API was developed by Princeton Instruments. 
This camera will take exposures of transients identified in the Swift/UVOT Serendipitous source catalog. The amount of time for each exposure will vary depending on the brightness of the target.
